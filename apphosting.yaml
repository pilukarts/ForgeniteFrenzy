runConfig:
  # This setting controls how many instances of your application can run at once.
  # Firebase automatically scales the number of instances based on traffic.
  # Increasing this value allows Firebase to handle more concurrent players
  # during traffic spikes. For a production launch, you might increase this
  # to 100 or more, depending on your expected traffic.
